##Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the spotify app to  understand their customers better. It helps the app know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know the top songs and artists, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on different factors.

###Steps Followed for Spotify Dashboard
Step 1: Load Data into Power BI Desktop
Load the Spotify dataset into Power BI Desktop. This dataset is a CSV file containing information about tracks, artists, albums, genres, and user interactions.

Step 2: Open Power Query Editor

Open the Power Query Editor. In the "View" tab, under the "Data preview" section, check the options for "Column distribution," "Column quality," and "Column profile."
Ensure that "Column profiling based on the entire dataset" is selected to profile all rows, not just the first 1000.

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Check for errors, empty values, and anomalies in the dataset. Clean any data that contains nulls or incorrect values. For instance, if the "Track Popularity" column has null values, you might want to handle those appropriately by replacing them or filtering them out.

Step 4: Handle Missing Values

For columns like "Track Popularity" or "Artist Popularity," where missing values might be present, decide on a strategy. If only a small percentage of values are missing, you can exclude those from calculations (e.g., when calculating the average popularity score).

Step 5: Choose a Theme

In the report view, under the "View" tab, select an appropriate theme for your Spotify dashboard. This will set the color scheme and style of your report.

Step 6: Add Visuals for Key Metrics

Use the three ellipses in the visualizations pane to add new visuals. For example:
Bar Chart: Represent the distribution of track popularity across different genres or artists.
Pie Chart: Show the percentage distribution of different genres or artist types (e.g., solo artists vs. bands).
Line Chart: Display the trend of a particular artist's popularity over time.

Step 7: Add Visual Filters (Slicers)

Add slicers to filter the data by important fields such as "Artist Name," "Genre," "Year of Release," and "Track Popularity." This allows users to interactively explore the dataset by filtering down to specific subsets of interest.

Step 8: Add Card Visuals for Summary Metrics

Add card visuals to the canvas to display key metrics such as:
The average track popularity.
The total number of tracks in the dataset.
The number of unique artists or genres.
Use visual-level filters from the filters pane to exclude null values or outliers from these calculations.

Step 9: Add a Bar Chart for Artist Comparison

Create a bar chart to compare the number of tracks for top artists or the popularity of different artists. Add "Genre" or "Album" to the Legends bucket to show a breakdown by genre or album.

Step 10: Create a Visual for Ratings

If your dataset includes user ratings for tracks or albums, create a visual that shows the average ratings. Use a similar approach to the one described, where specific parameters like "Audio Quality," "Lyrics," "Instrumental," etc., are represented. Ignore any ratings with a value of 0, indicating "not applicable" or "no rating."

Step 11: Add Text Boxes for Titles and Descriptions

In the report view, under the "Insert" tab, add text boxes to label the dashboard. For example, you could add a text box with "Spotify Analytics Dashboard" as the title and another with a brief description of the dashboard's purpose.
